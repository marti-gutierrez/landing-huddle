### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

that the first thing I have to do defore starting to layout with *HTML* and *CSS* (or *SASS*), is to make a sketch.

So I can see the tags I'm using and not use extra classes and just focus on resetting the tags,

### Continued development

I missed to add the styles for when the form is wrongly filled and therefore give interactivity to the input with *js*.

## Acknowledgments

Most of the styles I saw in Jordan Alexander's *CSS course*, I just realized that some styles were repeat and didn't need a class and use a preprocessor to make the code more readable.
